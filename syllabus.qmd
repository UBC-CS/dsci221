## Introduction

Welcome to DSCI 221, where we study the fundamental data structures and algorithms that power modern computing. Building on your foundation in discrete mathematics, you'll learn to analyze algorithms rigorously, prove correctness, and understand the tradeoffs between different approaches to organizing and processing data. Along the way, you'll implement classic data structures in Python and see how these ideas apply to problems in data science.

## Course Description and Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. *Define* and articulate the functionality of classic data structures such as Stacks, Queues, Dictionaries, Priority Queues, etc. by their Abstract Data Type (ADT).

2. *Design* algorithms and structures to implement novel ADTs based on properties of the data and intended use of the data, using object-oriented problem decomposition.

3. *Implement* classic and novel data structures in modern Python, based upon lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs.

4. *Analyze* the efficiency (time and space) of algorithms and data structures using asymptotic notation.

5. *Justify* algorithmic choices using iterative and recursive proofs of correctness.

6. *Evaluate* asymptotic time and space trade-offs between implementation options.

7. *Identify* the structures and algorithms necessary for solving complex problems.

8. *Synthesize* and *apply* algorithmic and analytical design choices to form complete software solutions of classic problems.

## Lecture Material and Course Content

DSCI 221 meets officially MWF at 11am in MacMillan 158. After the first week, the schedule shifts:

- **Monday**: In-person lecture (MCML 158)
- **Tuesday**: Online video lecture (asynchronous)
- **Wednesday**: In-person lecture (MCML 158)
- **Friday**: No class (after week 1)

Class meetings will be a mixture of theoretical narrative, worked examples, and problem-solving exercises. You will learn about algorithmic efficiency, correctness proofs, and the design of data structures—applying these ideas to problems that arise in data science contexts.

## Course Requirements

Deliverables for the course include the following components:

1. **Programming Assignments (PAs)** — Three significant programming projects where you'll implement data structures and algorithms. Due approximately every 4-5 weeks.

2. **Homework (HWs)** — Three written assignments focusing on algorithm analysis, correctness proofs, and problem-solving. Due approximately every 4-5 weeks.

3. **Labs** — Ten weekly lab exercises providing hands-on practice with the concepts from lecture. Labs are completed on PrairieLearn.

4. **Examlets** — Five 50-minute assessments completed in the Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF). These are self-scheduled within a window and cover both conceptual and coding questions.

5. **Final Exam** — A comprehensive exam, self-scheduled in the CBTF during the final exam period.

## Grading

| Item                   | Weight          |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Programming Assignments| 9% (3 × 3%)     |
| Homework               | 9% (3 × 3%)     |
| Labs                   | 10% (10 × 1%)   |
| Examlets               | 50% (5 × 10%)   |
| Final Exam             | 22%             |

You must pass the final exam (50%) to pass the course.
