Welcome to {{< var course.code >}}: Data Structures and Algorithms for Data Science!

In this course, we'll explore how the right data structure can turn an impossible problem into a trivial one. From the magic of hash tables (how does Shazam identify a song in milliseconds?) to graph algorithms (what's the cheapest flight to Tokyo?), you'll develop the algorithmic thinking that separates good programmers from great ones.

**Getting started:**

- Read the [syllabus](/syllabus.qmd) for course policies and requirements
- Check the schedule on the [home page](/) to see what's coming up
- Come to class ready to think about puzzles!

See you in class!
